#Getting Started

###Python Stack
Several options exist for running scripts on your machine. On OSX, I recommend using the package manager homebrew: http://brew.sh/. 

Building a nice functonal version of python with all needed dependencies can be tough, especially if you're coming from a language like MATLAB. You will learn a bit about how software and computers work though!

#On OSX
This guide have helped me in the past, but is a bit dated:

In general, you'll need to install:

<code>ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"</code>


#On Windows
Install Linux or buy a MacBook.
