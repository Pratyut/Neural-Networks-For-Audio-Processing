#Getting Started

##Python Stack
Several options exist for running scripts on your machine. On OSX, I recommend using the package manager homebrew: http://brew.sh/. 

Building a nice functonal version of python with all needed dependencies can be tough, especially if you're coming from a language like MATLAB. You will learn a bit about how software and computers work though!

###On OSX
This guide has helped me in the past, but is a bit dated:

###On Windows
Install Linux or buy a MacBook. 

Just kidding, there's some way to make this work, but I have no idea what it is.

##Running iPython Notebook
Once all software is installed, navigate the the proper directory in the terminal and type:

<code>ipython notebook --pylab inline</code>

The pylab automatically imports useful things like scipy, numpy, matplotlib. The inline command makes the plots inline with the notebook, as opposed to popping them out. 

##Github
Nice summary of fundamentals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE Generally on this project, contributors will fork the repository to make a local copy, edit away, and submit pull requests to merge thier code back in.
